can style 3 ways:
	inine
		use the style attribute within the element tag you want to style i.e. paragraph
	stylesheet; embedded within the document
	external style sheet

	css weight: which rule is heavier, inline styling rules are heavier and override embedded style sheets
-->
	
	<title>css embedded styling</title>
	<style type="text/css">
		p{

			font-family: helvetica;
		}
	</style>
