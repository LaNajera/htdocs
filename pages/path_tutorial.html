<!-- relative file paths vs abosolute file paths

relative urls
just use the file name and you have to name the dir structure to where the images or assets are

absolute urls
absolute url for index = localhost:8888/index.html this can be used to link 
if you use absolute urls for things like images, i.e. http://localhost:8888/cartes-cantabria1.png and if you ever move your site, imagine the localhost:8888 is the top domain, then things break. or if you are pointing to content not your own and you are not in control of that path health it can also break

remember to avoid using spaces in folder and file names

/ at the beginning of a file path means "go back to the rood dir"

../ means go up one folder

filename/ means look in that folder
