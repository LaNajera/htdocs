<!-- images info, you can use just the width attribute and leave height blank to make sure images scale, always resize images and optimize for web... um i'll have to research this

all images need an alt value, alt text about the image for google search engines and the text will show up if the image doesn't load

if the image doesn't load, the width/height attributes will tell the browser how to save that space in the layout for the missing image and you will see the broken image link with that amount of space saved -->
